Data Mining project – Student Performance Prediction using ML
# Student Performance Prediction & Learning Behavior Analysis

This repository contains my Data Mining course project for CS 435/535.

## Files
- `data_mining_project.ipynb` – Full data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and analysis
- `Data Mining final project report.pdf` – Detailed project report explaining methodology, results, and insights

## Dataset
Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)

## Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Apriori association rule mining
- Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Goal
Predict student success/failure and analyze learning behavior patterns such as binge learning, steady learning, comeback, and burnout.
